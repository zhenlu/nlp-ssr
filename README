This assignment is developed in Ruby.
Ruby and rake are needed to run all the programs.
No other libs are used.

Part 1
	- p1/ontology.txt is the ontology defination
	- p1/s1.txt~s9.txt are the representation of 9 sentences

Part 2
	- p2/src is the generator code
	- p2/data contains lexicon and grammar
	- p2/result contains the result
		- p2/result/process1.txt and process2.txt are the process steps for each sentences
	- You can run part 2 code in p2 directory using "rake" command

Part 3
	- p3/src is the realizier code
	- p3/data contains all the input files, lexicon and grammar
	- p3/result contains the result
		- p3/result/process1.txt~process9.txt are the process steps for each sentences
		- p3/result/result.txt is the output of the 10 sentances
	- You can run part 3 code in p3 directory using "rake" command
	
Part 4
	- 4.1 is in p4/relation.eps
	- 4.2 is in p4/data/plan.dat
	- 4.3 is in p4/src
	- 4.4 is in p4/result
		- p4/result/process1, tree1 show the process and tree starting E4 in story 1
		- p4/result/process2, tree2 show the process and tree starting E1 in story 1
		- p4/result/process3, tree3 show the process and tree starting E10 in story 2
		- p4/result/result.txt
	- You can run part 4 code in p4 directory using "rake" command
		
Discussion:
	- Lexicon
		I use a map in lexicon, for example I use V,type,time,form to represent a verb. 
		So a verb eat can be
		V,eat,current,singular -> eats
		V,eat,current,plural -> eat
		V,eat,past,singular -> ate
		V,eat,past,plural -> ate
		V,eat,future,singular -> will eat
		V,eat,future,plural -> will eat
		
		So it can fix the tence and form problem.
		
	- Negative sentance
		I use AUX to represent negative sentence, I have a record in lexicon
		AUX,*,NEG,current->do not
		So it can handle negative sentences.
		
	- Backtracking
		In part 3, I have a backtracking algorithm and each time a sentence is produced, 
		I check if it covers all element in the representation. If so, I put the sentence 
		in the answer list and continue searching.
		
	- I also can handle simple question sentence. See input file s14.txt.
