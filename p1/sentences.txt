1. At In-N-Out, we know that nothing complements a hamburger like tasty hot french-fries.

 (:type know)
 (:agent we)
 (:patient ((:id FACT1)
			(:type complement)
			(:agent ((:id FRY1)

2. Regarding french-fries, we feel that fresh is the best [way].
((:id SEN2)
 (:type feel)
 (:agent we)
 (:patient ((:id FACT2)
			(:type STATE)
			(:experiencer ((:id FRY2)
				  		   (:type fresh)

					       (:form singular)
						  ))
			(:attribute ((:id K2)
						 (:type good)
						 (:degree 10)
						))
		   ))

3. A french-fry is only as good as the potato [it comes from].
((:id SEN3)
 (:type STATE)
 (:experiencer ((:id FRY1)
				(:type french-fry)
				(:identifiable F)
				(:form singular)
  			   ))

 			  (:type good)
			  (:same-as ((:id POTATO1)
					     (:type potato)

						))
   			  ))
)

4. So we use fresh large potatoes.
